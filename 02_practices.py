# Q.1 

# import pandas as pd

# # Load the datasets (if not already loaded)
# cars1 = pd.read_csv('cars1.csv')
# cars2 = pd.read_csv('cars2.csv')

# # Combine both datasets into one
# cars = pd.concat([cars1, cars2], ignore_index=True)

# print(cars.shape)    # Shows total rows and columns
# print(cars.head())   # See the first 5 rows
# print(cars.tail())   # See the last 5 rows
